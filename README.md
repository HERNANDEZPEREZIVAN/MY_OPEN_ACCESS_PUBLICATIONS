The file **"Applied Sciences (2021)"** is a study on the thermal performance of building roofs with traditional and solar reflective coatings in Mexico. The results presented in this article are relevant for those building users/owners when selecting waterproofing materials for their homes.

The file **"Buildings (2023)"** presents the results of a refurbishment of a solar interest building in Mexico using Earth to Air Heat Exchangers. The results presented in this article are relevant for those building users/owners when seeking energy savings for their homes.

The file **"CMES (2020)"** shows a numerical study of the distribution of temperatures and relative humidity in a room situated in warm climate conditions. The results presented in this article are relevant for those building users/owners who wish to know how relative humidity and temperature affect thermal comfort conditions.

The file **"Energies (2018)"** presents a study that estimates the wind energy potential of two sites in Mexico.

The file **"Energies (2019)"** shows the analysis of the thermal and energetic behavior of a domestic refrigerator by experimentally evaluating the main effects of the thermal load (food) and the variation of the ambient temperature.

The file **"Energies (2022)"** shows a review and analysis of the state-of-the-art TABS was carried out to identify their potential to improve thermal comfort conditions
and provide energy savings. Furthermore, this study presents the gaps identified in the literature so that researchers can develop future studies on TABS.

The file **"M&I (2020)"**  presents the thermal and ventilation potential of a geothermal Earth-to-Air Heat exchanger (EAHE) studied for six weather in Mexico. The results presented in this article are relevant for those building users/owners when seeking energy savings for their homes.
